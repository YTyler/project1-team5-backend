    The Project 1 is a social media application utilizing nodejs and react to provide people a way to interact with one another.
We are group 5, and the memebers consist of Jacob Kula, Matthew Otto, and Tyler Yates. We named our project, Sylph, it is based 
off a Reddit clone. It includes Users and Threads that people can use to post their favorite moments and have people interact 
with them. 
    There are a different types of Users, they are Admins, Moderators, Users, and Visitors. They all have different roles that
they can do. The Visitors are only allowed to view the Threads and that is it they cannot comment anything and they do not have
a login. The Users have a login and password saved in the database, they are allowed to comment on posts, and they can edit 
their own profile. The Moderators can do everything that a User can do however they can also do more as well. They can delete 
other Users posts and comments. They have more power than the Users because they are assigned the role rather than just making 
an account. The final role is Admins, they have the most power of any role. They can appoint Moderators as well as remove them.
Their final power is that they can delete Users.
    This Project 1 that we made consists of a front-end and a back-end. The front-end of the project consists of the HTML, CSS,
and React code that the user will interact with. The back-end of the project consists of Typescript and Javascript, it is all
code that the user will never interact with, on purpose. The back-end is the Restful API that interacts with a Dynamodb table 
that will hold all the information that the user will use and see.
